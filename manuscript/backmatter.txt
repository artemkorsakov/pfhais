# Epilogue #

Q> So what have we gained from this?

I personally hope that you had some fun reading this, have learned something and got some ideas about what is possible in the realm of programming. For me it was fun to write this book and I also learned a lot while writing it. I want to thank all the people that got back to me with questions, hints and ideas about what might be missing.

The next time some person points out that all this "academic functional nonsense" is for naught please remember some of the things you read here. We have seen several things that imply that we can use pure functional programming in our daily work:

1. better understandable code
2. better testable code
3. better performing code (Yes!)
4. better type safety using refined types
5. deriving boilerplate code from our statically typed models and logic
6. easier working with deeply nested structures using optics

There really is no excuse to stick to impure and messy stuff that is hard to maintain. But please remember also that functional programming is not done for the sake of itself. It is another and in my opinion better way to deliver value. In our field of work this (*value*) usually means some working software / program / application / whatever.

Also please do not consider this book a complete knowledge trove. Several things might already be outdated, some topics have only been scratched on the surface and other things are missing completely.

So, people of the baud and the electron: Go out there, venture forth, cross boundaries, use the knowledge which is there and last but not least - Have fun!

## Moving to Scala 3...

When I wrote this book version 2.12 was the thing and 2.13 was not yet released. While I did enable cross-building for 2.13 the next big version was still far away. But then it happened and Scala 3 was released. However it took some time until libraries and frameworks moved to support it. As I am writing this some still have not added support for it because in some areas this involves a significant amount of work.

However, I always wanted to do an update to Scala 3 and while I might still find time to write a complete book about that, I chose not to wait longer although some libraries I would like to use are still not ported. Therefore the topic of this chapter will be to update our small service (the tapir version) to Scala 3 while dropping some not yet ported libraries.

But instead of jumping right into the middle of it we might be better of to look at our options and plan our migration accordingly.

The first step should be to switch to Scala 2.13 as major version and update all dependencies to their latest versions. This alone will be quite some work but it will ease the migration to Scala 3 for which we will try to use some tools which are available.
